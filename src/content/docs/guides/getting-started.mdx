The MSC Design System is constructed atop the robust Tailwind CSS framework, starting from its initial release (version 0.0.0). This foundation ensures that the components are not only highly customizable but also adhere to a standardized set of design principles. While customization is possible, it is advisable to stay within the prescribed guidelines of the design system to maintain consistency and integrity.

<br />
Within this Design System, you will discover the following elements that embody the
MSC corporate identity:

- **Foundations**: The essential building blocks that lay the groundwork for cohesive design language.
- **Tokens**: Atomic design elements that serve as the visual vocabulary for the system.
- **Core Systems**: The set of rules and patterns that govern the interaction of design elements.
- **Components**: The modular and reusable elements that expedite the design and development process.

<br />
By leveraging these defined styles, the MSC Design System facilitates the creation
of digital experiences that are both aesthetically pleasing and functionally robust,
ensuring a seamless brand representation across all platforms.
