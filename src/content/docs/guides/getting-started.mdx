Here at MSC we make sure that what we do aligns with the following principles and purposes:

<br />
### Our single source of truth for Designers, Developers and Product Managers.
<br />
MSC Design System is the central source of truth that brings together all the elements,
principles, and guidelines enabling our product team to ignite ideas, design, and
develop features efficiently.
<br />
You'll find seamless integration with Figma for designers and access precise size
elements without disrupting the flow, along with comprehensive data for every padding
specification you require.
<br />
On the tech front, you'll witness the different states of delivery through our custom-built
design system using Tailwind CSS.
<br />
### Content, Brand, and Product: Our All-Encompassing Vision.
<br />
We've formulated MDS as an all-encompassing vision where all design teams converge:
brand, content, and product. We collaborate to produce a uniform end-to-end experience
that addresses the demands of our company. Building the Foundations, Brick by Brick
<br />
By prioritizing the most crucial elements and working hand-in-hand with the Tech
team, we're constructing our design system as a product with its own backlog, evolving
over time.
<br />
This is the inaugural version of our platform, and we're continually refining it.
