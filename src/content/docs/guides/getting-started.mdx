Here at MSC we make sure that what we do aligns with the following principles and purposes:

<br />
### Our single source of truth for Designers, Developers and Product Managers.
<br />
MSC Design System is the central source of truth that brings together all the elements,
principles, and guidelines enabling our product team to ignite ideas, design, and
develop features efficiently.
<br />
You'll find seamless integration with Figma for designers and access precise size
elements without disrupting the flow, along with comprehensive data for every padding
specification you require.
<br />
On the tech front, you'll witness the different states of delivery through our custom-built
design system using Tailwind CSS.
<br />
### Content, Brand, and Product: Our All-Encompassing Vision.
<br />
We've formulated MDS as an all-encompassing vision where all design teams converge:
brand, content, and product. We collaborate to produce a uniform end-to-end experience
that addresses the demands of our company. Building the Foundations, Brick by Brick
<br />
By prioritizing the most crucial elements and working hand-in-hand with the Tech
team, we're constructing our design system as a product with its own backlog, evolving
over time.
<br />
This is the inaugural version of our platform, and we're continually refining it.
<br />
### Simplicity at Your Fingertips.
<br />
Recognizing the importance of effortless usability, you can harness Fuel simply through
Figma by searching for a component, colors or typography, and gaining immediate onboarding
for its utilization.
<br />
You don't need an hour-long briefing to use it straightforwardly while adhering to
our guidelines.
<br />
Each component has a dedicated page with best practices, and you'll find exact measurements
on Figma tabs for every onboarding process.
<br />
If the component is an organism or a template, you'll find an explanation within
Figma to facilitate its usage. We've made it simple to create and easy to use, powered
by our custom-built design system using Tailwind CSS.
